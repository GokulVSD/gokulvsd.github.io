# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **Gokul Vasudeva** ðŸ‘‹<br>
I enjoy keeping things organised in a cohesive manner, including data about myself.
To that extent, this is my personal website / blog / showcase. I periodically update my blog with new posts, reflecting what I'm up to.
I also use this website as a professional showcase, including keeping an up-to-date resume available, and a list of my personal projects and achievements. <br> <br>
Professionally, I'm a Computer Science Engineer, who has loved computers, including everything related to them, ever since I was exposed to them when I was about 10. <br> <br>
I treasure experiences new and old, and feel that life is too short to not enjoy the little things, having fun along the way. I have a strong desire to do things right the
first time, which requires me to plan things out, and employ foresight, which is a double edged sword. I've been told my superpower ðŸ¦¸ is resilience, and I'm great at coming up with names for things. I regularly ponder about philosophy,
science, and our existence. I consider myself to be an optimistic realist, with a good sense of humour. <br> <br>
In terms of my career aspirations, my ideal career trajectory would have me working in the intersection of highly scalable distributed systems, operating systems, and production Machine Learning.

#### **Hobbies & Interests**

I mentioned above how I've been in love with computers and everything related to them from a young age. Naturally, most of my hobbies stem from the afformentioned love.

For the longest time, I was an enthusiast video producer / video editor. This stemmed from my fascination with creating beautiful motion, and telling a story in the process.
This fascination is also why I love art in the form of movies and video. I understand that some may scoff at this, but from my pre-teens till date, the stuff I find so Ã¼ber cool
is cool tech and computer hardware. I frequently keep myself updated on advances in computer hardware, and new tech coming out, and have picked parts and built dozens of computers
for friends and family. Sticking with the above themes, naturally, I'm an avid gamer, and game tinkerer, both of which occupied major chunks of my adolescence. I still play games late night on weekends with my friends, with CSGO, Valorant, Minecraft and social/party/co-op games regularly filling the agenda.

I keep in shape by consistently playing badminton and swimming once or twice every week, and by going on hikes and treks once in a few months.

I'm a movie buff, and a massive YouTube consumer. I've watched my fair share of sitcoms and dramas over the years, but that's dwindled
to make time for other interests. If I were to point at one sport that I follow in any sense of the word, it would be Formula One, which
I find to be quite gripping entertainment. I used to watch a ton of anime, but that's also dwindled in recent years.

Throwing an oddball, I'm strangely interested in civil engineering and infrastructure as well as aviation, as it gives me pleasure to witness humanity advance. I also enjoy tea ~~way more than~~ just as much as coffee.

People keep asking me why I always introduce myself as someone who enjoys long walks on the beach. That's just me being sarcastic, as I'm a native of Bengaluru, and have never lived
near a beach in my life, let alone gone for a long walk on one. I would, however, like to.
