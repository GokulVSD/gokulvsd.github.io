# **About Me**

{{ site.description }}

#### **Hobbies & Interests**

I mentioned above how I've been in love with computers and everything related to them from a young age. Naturally, most of my hobbies stem from the afformentioned love.

For the longest time, I was an enthusiast video producer / video editor. This stemmed from my fascination with creating beautiful motion, and telling a story in the process.
This fascination is also why I love art in the form of movies and video. I understand that some may scoff at this, but from my pre-teens till date, the stuff I find so Ã¼ber cool
is cool tech and computer hardware. I frequently keep myself updated on advances in computer hardware, and new tech coming out, and have picked parts and built dozens of computers 
for friends and family. Sticking with the above themes, naturally, I'm an avid gamer, and game tinkerer, both of which occupied major chunks of my adolescence.

Throwing an oddball, I'm strangely interested in civil engineering and infrastructure, as it gives me pleasure to witness humanity advance. I also enjoy tea way more than coffee.

People keep asking me why I always introduce myself as someone who enjoys long walks on the beach. That's just me being sarcastic, as I'm a native of Bengaluru, and have never lived
near a beach in my life, let alone gone for a long walk on one. I would, however, like to.
