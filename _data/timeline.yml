                <br><br><b>❯❯</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; SpotIQ is ThoughtSpot's AI driven analytics engine, where I worked towards improving relevancy of AI generated insights by statistically modelling salient metrics and writing optimisation algorithms to improve querying efficiency over cloud-connected data stores. Introduced a machine learning library to replace handwritten statistical modelling logic.
                <br><br><b>❯❯</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Spearheaded and took ownership of migrating SpotIQ to v2, which involved building a robust set of high throughput APIs to merge complex functionality by interfacing with multiple services, unlocking new features, and improving ROI.
                <br><br><b>❯❯</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Drastically improved SpotIQ codebase and testing, improved query efficiency and error tolerance, caught and fixed a large number of critical bugs, all of which allowed for new use cases and massive improvement to SpotIQ reliability.
                <br><br><b>❯❯</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Took ownership and was the POC for SpotIQ Comparative Analysis, significantly improving it in the process. Worked on improving a scheduler built using Go. Built Jenkins pipelines for performing ETL on testing metrics from Gradle.
