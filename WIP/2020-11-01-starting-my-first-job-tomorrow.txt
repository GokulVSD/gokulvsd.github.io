## The backstory

This is a follow up to [Waiting Around Due To Covid](/blog/waiting-around-due-to-covid), get back to this after reading that.

## What have I managed to do these last few months?

* Had LASIK eye surgery to correct my vision, and recovered. Took about 2 weeks for me to comfortably sit infront of a computer for long periods of time.
* Got my scooter serviced.
* Developed and deployed a personal [website / blog](https://gokulvsd.github.io) (Hello!).
* Organised my digital life (set up showcases for previous projects, added documentation for projects which previously didn't have any, updated my social and professional pages to be more accurate, created a new [resume](/resume) that's rendered dynamically from YAML source files).
* [Learnt to code in Go](/blog/go-a-comprehensive-overview), the programming language (and documented my journey with the help of my blog).
* Started to Learn how to query in GraphQL.
* Started looking into contributing to [DGraph](https://dgraph.io/), the GraphQL database built with Go.
* Practiced on [dozens of LeetCode problems](https://github.com/GokulVSD/ScratchPad/tree/master/LeetCode). 
* Spent some quality time with my family and friends by hangling out, playing video games and having group video calls.

For all intents and purposes, I'm a full fledged adult now. I entered 2010 as I simultaneously entered my teens, and came out of 2020 feeling like the last decade went by so quickly. I get now why people always say that your adolescence is the only time in your life where you regularly are forced to meet new people and experience new things, without having to put in any extra effort. I feel like I'm going to miss that ease. 

## The job

I was campus hired by Societe Generale during August of 2019. They're one of the three big banks in France, and I've been hired as a Software Engineer in Global Technology Services. 
Looking forward to learning and experiencing new tech, and finally starting to earn some mula.
