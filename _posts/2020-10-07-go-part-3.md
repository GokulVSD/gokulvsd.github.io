## Pointers

Go supports pointers. The type `*T` is a pointer to a T value. Its zero value is `nil` (Go's equivalent of null is nil). Similar to C, the `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand, and `*` is the "dereferencing" or "indirecting" operator.

```go
func pointerTest() {
	i, j := 2, 25 // regular int variables

	var p *int
	p = &i
	// OR with shorthand:
	p := &i         // point to i

	fmt.Println(*p) // read i through the pointer (prints 2)
	*p = 1         // set i through the pointer
	fmt.Println(i)  // see the new value of i (prints 1)

	p = &j         // point to j
	*p = *p / 5   // divide j through the pointer
	fmt.Println(j) // see the new value of j (prints 5)

	fmt.Println(p) // prints 0xc000100018 (address of j)
```

However, unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

```go
	p = p + 1
	q := &i
	p = p + q // All these fail
}
```

## Struct

A struct is a collection of fields. Struct fields are accessed using a dot.

```go
type Vertex struct {
	X int
	Y string
}

func structTest() {
	fmt.Println(Vertex{1, "hello"}) // Prints {1 hello}

	v := Vertex{1, "hello"}
	v.X = 4
	fmt.Println(v.X) // prints 4
}
```

Struct fields can be accessed through a struct pointer. To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write `(*p).X`. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just `p.X`, without the explicit dereference.

```go
	p := &v
	p.X = 1e9 // same as (*p).X = 1e9
	fmt.Println(v) // prints {1000000000 hello}

	fmt.Println(p) // prints &{1000000000 hello}
```

Different struct literals:

```go
v1 := Vertex{1, "hello"}
v2 := Vertex{Y: "hello", X: 1} // order doesn't matter when explicitly naming variables
v3 := Vertex{Y: "world"} // All other variables take 0 value
v4 := Vertex{} // All variables take 0 value
```

## Arrays

The type `[n]T` is an array of n values of type T. An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.

```go
func arrayTest() {

	var a [2]string // declares a variable a as an array of two strings.

	a[0] = "Hello"
	a[1] = "World"
	fmt.Println(a[0], a[1]) // prints Hello World
	fmt.Println(a) // prints [Hello World]

	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13} // an array literal
	fmt.Println(primes) // prints [2 3 5 7 11 13]
}
```

## Slices

An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array. In practice, slices are much more common than arrays. The type `[]T` is a slice with elements of type T. A slice is formed by specifying two indices, a low and high bound, separated by a colon: `a[low : high]`, which includes low, excludes high.

```go
func sliceTest() {
	primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}

	var s []int = primes[1:4]
	fmt.Println(s) // prints [3 5 7]
}
```

When slicing, you may omit the high or low bounds to use their defaults instead. The default is zero for the low bound and the length of the slice for the high bound. The following are all the same for creating a slice of an array a which has a length of 10:
```
a[0:10]
a[:10]
a[0:]
a[:]
```

A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array. Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array. Other slices that share the same underlying array will see those changes.

```go
names := [3]string{
	"john",
	"paul",
	"ringo"
} // regular array

a := names[0:2]
b := names[1:3]  // a and b are slices

fmt.Println(names) // prints [john paul ringo]
fmt.Println(a) // prints [john paul]
fmt.Println(b) // prints [paul ringo]

b[0] = "george"

fmt.Println(names) // prints [john george ringo]
fmt.Println(a) // prints [john george]
fmt.Println(b) // prints [george ringo]
```

A slice literal is like an array literal without the length. This is an array literal: `[3]bool{true, true, false}`

The following slice literal creates the same array as above, then builds a slice that references it: `[]bool{true, true, false}`

```go
q := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
fmt.Println(q) // prints [2 3 5 7 11 13]

s := []struct {
	i int
	b bool
}{
	{2, true},
	{3, false},
	{5, true},
}

fmt.Println(s) // prints [{2 true} {3 false} {5 true}]
```

## Slice properties

A slice has both a length and a capacity. The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice. The length and capacity of a slice `s` can be obtained using the expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)`. You can extend a slice's length by re-slicing it, provided it has sufficient capacity. If you try extending the slice beyond it's capacity, Go will throw a runtime error. 

```go
s := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // a slice

fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s) // prints len=5 cap=5 [1 2 3 4 5]

// Slice the slice to give it zero length.
s = s[:0]
fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s) // prints len=0 cap=5 []

// Extend its length.
s = s[:4]		// if you try extending as s = s[:6], you get a runtime error
fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s) // prints len=4 cap=5 [1 2 3 4]

// Drop its first two values.
s = s[2:]
fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s) // prints len=2 cap=3 [3 4]
```

The zero value of a slice is nil. A nil slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.

```go
var s []int
if s == nil {	// evaluates to true
	fmt.Println("nil!")
}
```

Slices can contain any type, including other slices.

```go
board := [][]string{
	[]string{"_", "_"},
	[]string{"_", "_"},
}

board[0][0] = "X"
board[0][1] = "O"
board[1][0] = "X"
board[1][1] = "O"

for i := 0; i < len(board); i++ {
	fmt.Printf("%s\n", strings.Join(board[i], " "))
}
// prints:
// X O
// X O
```

## Dynamic slices

Slices can be created with the built-in make function; this is how you create dynamically-sized arrays. The make function allocates a zeroed array and returns a slice that refers to that array:

```	
a := make([]int, 5)  	// len(a)=5

// To specify a capacity, pass a third argument to make:
b := make([]int, 0, 5) 	// len(b)=0, cap(b)=5
```

## Appending to a slice:

`func append(s []T, value/s ...T) []T`

The first parameter s of append is a slice of type T, and the rest are T values to append to the slice. The resulting value of append is a slice containing all the elements of the original slice plus the provided values. If the backing array of s is too small to fit all the given values, a bigger array will be allocated. The returned slice will point to the newly allocated array.

```go
var s []int
s = append(s, 0) // len=1 cap=1, prints [0]
s = append(s, 1, 2, 3, 4) // len=4 cap=6 [0 1 2 3 4]
```

## Range operator

The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map. When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a copy of the element at that index.

```go
for i, v := range pow {
	fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
} // prints 2**0 = 1 ...

// You can skip the index or value by assigning to _.
for i, _ := range pow
for _, value := range pow
// If you only want the index, you can omit the second variable.
for i := range pow
```

## Maps

A map maps keys to values. The zero value of a map is nil. A nil map has no keys, nor can keys be added. The make function returns a map of the given type, initialized and ready for use.

```go
type Vertex struct {
	Lat, Long float64
}

var m map[string]Vertex

func mapTest(){
	m = make(map[string]Vertex)
	m["Bell Labs"] = Vertex{
		40.68433, -74.39967,
	}
	fmt.Println(m["Bell Labs"]) // prints {40.68433 -74.39967}
}
```

Map literals are like struct literals, but the keys are required.
```go
var m = map[string]Vertex{
	"Bell Labs": Vertex{
		40.68433, -74.39967,
	},
	"Google": Vertex{
		37.42202, -122.08408,
	},
}

fmt.Println(m) // prints map[Bell Labs:{40.68433 -74.39967} Google:{37.42202 -122.08408}]
```
you can omit `Vertex` inside since it is a type name, like `"Google": {37.42202, -122.08408,}`

To delete a key from a map m, `delete(m, key)`

You can test that a key is present in a map with a two-value assignment:

```go
elem, ok := m[key]
// If key is in m, ok is true. If not, ok is false.
// If key is not in the map, then elem is the zero value for the map's element type.
```

Here's an example use case of maps, a function for counting frequency of words in a string:

```go
import (
	"strings"
)

func WordCount(s string) map[string]int {
	m := make(map[string]int)
	for _, w := range strings.Fields(s) {
		m[w]++
	}
	return m
}
```

## Functions values

Functions are values too. They can be passed around just like other values. Function values may be used as function arguments and return values.

```go
func compute(fn func(float64, float64) float64) float64 {
	return fn(3, 4)
}

func funcValTest(){
	hypot := func(x, y float64) float64 {
		return math.Sqrt(x*x + y*y)
	}
	fmt.Println(compute(hypot)) // prints 5
	fmt.Println(compute(math.Pow)) // prints 81 (which is 3**4)
}
```

## Function Closures

Go functions may be closures. A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables; in this sense the function is "bound" to the variables. For example, the adder function returns a closure. Each closure is bound to its own sum variable.

```go
func adder() func(int) int {
	sum := 0
	return func(x int) int {
		sum += x
		return sum
	}
}

func funcClosureTest() {
	pos, neg := adder(), adder()
	for i := 1; i < 4; i++ {
		fmt.Println(pos(i), neg(-i)
	} 
	// prints 1 -1
	// 		  3 -3
	//		  6 -6
}
```

Here's a cool use case for function closures. Each call to the function `f` returns the next fibonacci number

```go
func fibonacci() func() int {
	x, y, z := 1, 0, 0
	return func() int {
		z = x + y
		x = y
		y = z
		return x
	}
}

func main() {
	f := fibonacci()
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		fmt.Println(f())
	} // prints 0 1 1 2 3 5 ... upto the 10th fibonacci number
}
```
