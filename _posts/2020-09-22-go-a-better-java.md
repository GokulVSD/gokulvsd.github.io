## What led me here

Well, I decided to take the opportunity bestowed upon me by the Covid gods to start learning Go.
The process of deciding what I wanted to use these 2 months for was a lot more indecisive than I care to admit. I first looked into creating a game engine from scratch with C++,
but trashed that idea when I saw how overcrowded that space was. I didn't want to learn just another language, as at this point, I feel like learning a language is just reading
up their docs to check out their features and syntax. I don't really gain anything on a fundamental level after doing a 4 year undergrad where you're taught so many different
programming paradigms.

Nonetheless, I had a desire to contribute to something where my contributions would be meaningful. Looking at the crowded nature of contributing to things I already know, it seemed
logical to learn a new language and contribute to the language's development, instead of looking for stuff that by learning, benefits me.

Go was pretty much the winner of a coin toss between Rust and Go. I would love to learn Rust at a later date, as I've heard great things, and the features are right up my ally, but I don't
really feel like doing low level stuff right now.

The next question was what I would do after I learn Go. Well I'll get to that when I feel like I've gotten a good handle. I thought of creating a game engine with Go, but from the sounds of things,
it doesn't feel like it's mature or performant enough for that. I'll most probably just start contributing to same Go database projects.

## The setup

I followed the [Go Docs](https://golang.org/doc/), things went pretty smoothly. First impressions are that its pretty straight forward, kinda feels like how it felt learning Python for the first time.
I like that they manage external packages per repository using a go.mod file.

I'll update this post as I continue learning.
